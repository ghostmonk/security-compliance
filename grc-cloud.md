# Compliance in the Cloud

- Always consider the primary focus of the GRC strategy
- Better manage risk
- who is in charge
- CISO Chief Internal Security Officer
- Who reports primary metrics
- Decisions need to be made... who does that?
- What and how are your tools and techniques employed to ensure a successful GRC program?

# Cloud GRC
- There isn't much of a difference
- There isn't a lot existing already... so it's a lot of bespoke tinkering 
- You will need to work with your cloud provider to understand what your responsibilities as the client are
- Typically you are responsible for your own content and data
- You should have an experienced legal team to be able to understand all of the controls

# Complexities
- auditing the data and understanding where the boundaries are... what are you responsible for, what are you not responsible for?
- what happens if another company get access to our data? Can it happen?
- The organization is always responsible for their own data
