# Governance Risk Managment and Compliance

Risk Management
1. identify the risk
2. imact assessment
3. Developing a strategy

Risk management strategies
- Acceptance (probably not going to happen)
- Transference (transfer the risk)
- Mitigate (can't accept can't transfer... must mitigate)
- Avoidance (don't do the thing that causes the risk)

Compliance 
- Governance needs to marry with compliance
- Marrying the governance rules to compliance rules
- Implement Monitoring Controls
- Implement Assessment controls

Identify Risks --> Assess Risks --> 
Select controls --> Implement Controls --> 
Access Controls --> Monitor Controls --> 
Identify Risks

Some risks don't need controls, we need to do an impact assessment on the risk
